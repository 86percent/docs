1. Go to [86% platform](https://editor.86percent.co){:target="_blank"}
2. Enter your email, password and name as shown on the screen capture below:

2. Give it a good name and choose your default language:

3. You're all set!

If you want to learn more on the Bot Editor, [open the Bot Editor documentation](editor.md)

### Basic integration concepts 

 - **Chatbot** : we refer as `chatbot` a scenario that is defined within the `web editor`.
 - **Conversation** : we refer as `conversation` the content of the exchange between the user and 86% SDK.   

Note that it's possible to play several bots in a single conversation, either by chaining bots together or by manually starting a bot in an existing conversation.

### Basic integration in your iOS App 

To run a bot within your App, there are 2 simple steps to `register` it and create a `conversation`.

#### Register your bot : 
1. First, initialize the SDK calling `EPManager`, the main class of 86% SDK API. 
2. Then, register any bot that you want to use in your App.  

Typically, you would define a function that you call from the `application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` in your `AppDelegate`.   

```swift
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        initializeEightySixPercent()
        return true
    }

    func initializeEightySixPercent() {
        EPManager.shared.initialize()
        EPManager.shared.registerBot(uuid: BotUUID.demoBot, fetchingStrategy: .onlineWithDefault(majorVersion: 4, fileName: "SimpleDemo.json"))
    }
```

**Where :** 
- `uuid` is the bot identifier. It can be found from the editor, in the [settings](editor.md/settings-uuid).
- `fetchingStrategy` can be of 3 kinds : 
    - `onlineWithDefault` (recommended): you provide the SDK with a default file to use in case of no internet. If you are connected though, the SDK will automatically update your bot tp the latest version defined in the editor and compatible with your App (see the section on `majorVersion`).    
    - `online`: the bot definition is loaded directly from the web and you don't need to provide any default file. It will raise an error if the user is not connected to internet.
    - `offline`: the bot definition is provided within the App build and will never change dynamically.
    
**FAQ :**
- **What is the file we're talking about?** 
This file contains the definition of your bot scenario. It is generated by the [editor](editor.md/settings-uuid).  
     
- **What is the majorVersion?**
Use this version to enforce compatibility between your App and your bot file. The SDK will automatically fetch new bot files once they are published in the editor. But only bot files with the same majorVersion value.
     
- **Where do I find my bot UUID?**
You can find the ID of your bot from the settings page of the editor :

#### Play your bot : 
    
To play your bot, you need to create a `conversation`, starting it with your `bot` and then you can present the 86% SDK main controller with your conversation played within.

```swift
    // Create a new conversation : 
    let conversation = EPChatConversation(botUuid: BotUUID.demoBot)
    
    // get the controller that displays this conversation :
    EPManager.shared.controller(for: conversation) { controller, error in
        if let controller = controller {
            controller.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(barButtonSystemItem: .stop, target: self, action: #selector(self.dismissController))
            self.presentController(UINavigationController(rootViewController: controller))
        } else {
            self.showAlert(message: error?.localizedDescription ?? "N/A")
        }
    }
```
